# AdventofCode

According to the AOC creator, Eric Wastl, "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like" 

You can check out the challenges for yourself [here](https://adventofcode.com/)

I will be taking on these challenges and sharing my code in this repo

Hope you enjoy!
